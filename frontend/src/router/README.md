# RouterWithContext.tsx

## Overview

The `RouterWithContext.tsx` file is a functional React component that integrates authentication and query client context into the TanStack Router. It serves as a wrapper to provide necessary context to the router.

## Functionality

This component utilizes the `useAuth` hook to retrieve authentication details and passes both the authentication object and the query client to the `RouterProvider`. This ensures that all routes within the application have access to the authentication state and query capabilities.

## Importance for TanStack Router Context

The `RouterWithContext` is essential for the TanStack Router as it allows the router to operate with the necessary context for authentication and data fetching. By providing this context, it enables seamless integration of authentication checks and data management across the application's routing structure.
