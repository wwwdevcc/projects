# Features Directory

The `features` directory contains all the logic and components for the application, organized into subfolders. Each subfolder is dedicated to a specific feature, encapsulating its related components, hooks, API calls, and types. This structure promotes modularity and maintainability, allowing for easier navigation and development of individual features.

## Structure
