# Overview

This is a hook for user authentication in a React application. It utilizes hooks to manage authentication state and user data.

# Functionality

The main functionality revolves around the useAuth hook, which manages the authentication state of the user. It checks the loading status, handles errors, and determines whether the user is authenticated or not. The useUserQuery function is responsible for fetching user data based on the authentication token.

# Usage

- To use the authentication features, import the useAuth hook in your component. This hook will return the current authentication state, including the user's information, loading status, and any errors encountered during the fetching process.
- The useUserQuery function is a custom hook that utilizes the useQuery hook. It fetches user data only if the authentication token is present, ensuring that requests are made only when necessary.
